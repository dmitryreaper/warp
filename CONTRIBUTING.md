# Issues

When filing an issue please include:

 - A complete description of the problem, as well as the minimal setup required to reproduce it.
 - The platform (wayland/macos/X).
 - The output of `warpd -v`.
 - The smallest possible config (if any) required to replicate the behaviour.
 - Your screen setup (the number of your monitors you have).

Before reporting a bug, please ensure it is present on the latest commit.

Also be aware that the master branch is the main development branch and
that things are liable to break between releases.
